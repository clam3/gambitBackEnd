Also, the white pawns on c4 and g5 cover escape routes for black\u2019s monarch, and white must keep checking, or lose to Qg2#!\nAre there any other moves? Well, white could have opened with 1 Kg1, Kh1, or Kh3, but since the puzzle moved 1 Kg3, we\u2019ll assume it was either the best of a bad lot, this puzzle was drawn from a database of actual games, or the puzzle was composed. Still, what if white had gone 1 Kh3? That\u2019ll avoid losing a tempo as 1 ... Nf5 would no longer give check, but black still needs to play it to cut the lines of communication between the queen and bishop. This means that white can now pick up the black bishop via checks, until the black king occupies the same rank (7) as his bishop, at which point white wins the undefended bishop via fork. We already saw that 2 Kh3 is pretty much forced; the only other legal move drops the queen. Therefore, let\u2019s look at 2 ... Bxf3 - is this the best?\nClearly, 2 ... Qxf3?? loses, and so does 2 ... Qf1+?? Likewise, 2 ... Qxh2+?? sucks, and the black pawn on e5 isn\u2019t going to be much help; it still needs 4 moves to promote, and it doesn\u2019t work even if it does threaten the white bishop, as black still has the problem of dropping his own bishop to a queen fork on the 7th rank! So 2 ... e4 isn\u2019t forcing enough, and the knight on f5 has no checks, either. I think I can safely conclude - without asking a chess engine - that 2 ... Bxf3 is best.\nHow about 3 Qe6+? Then 3 ... Kg7, or 3 ... Kf8. If 3 ... Kg7, 4 Qd7+ (and not Qe7+?? Nxe7) Kf8, 5 Qd8+ Kf7 But now 6 Qd7+ and black can interpose the knight 6 ... Ne7 and white is out of annoyance checks! The knight guards f5 and d5, and 7 Qxe7?? throws away the game. And if 3 Kf8, we just get the same sequence, one move earlier.

A lot of things are just going right over their heads, e.g. why the knight is so good on d6; even if they hear the words they don't parse them for whatever reason, and it just doesn't stick.\n\nIt feels like this game is better suited for teaching the U1350 class about tangible consequences of giving up the center. It's a textbook example of how a position gets worse over time after doing so. Sure, Black made errors with Be7, h6, Nb4, Nf6, etc. but these are great places to go to and ask \"OK, if those move are bad, what is Black supposed to do here?\" and then when they don't really find anything much better, ask \"Why can't Black do anything to improve his game? At the beginning it was equal, so what did White do that was so much better than Black?\" and the answer goes back to 6...dxc4. You can point out that while this move appears in theory, it only appears in very specific spots where Black's compensation is clear and adequate, and usually justified by lots of theory and results. This is not one of those spots. Even if Black tries to play typical Meran/Orthodox moves he's in trouble.\n\nThe point is that after ...dxc4, moves that equalize become progressively harder to find, and winning opportunities are almost completely nil. The computer evaluation doesn't change much, but your 1000-1350 students should be able to understand why Black is so much worse than the penalty of -0.7 or so. Moves like ...dxc4 are much more consequential than tactical errors like ...h6 or ...Nf6 in terms of deciding who is going to win or lose.\n\nPS if you miss watching Barry Sanders, take a look at some highlights from Iowa State's David Montgomery.

Also just moving the White king to F1 would mean that, the Black Bishop would have to move to either G2 or D2 to check the king, G2 would get the black bishop taken by the king while D2 would get the bishop taken by the white queen, which would then get taken by the black pawn, but would temporarily leave black with only the queen threatening the king at least for a while.",

That means that Black can't take Black's pawn on c7 with the hanging Bishop. It can be a nice way to unpin without having to play g5, which can cause so many problems, as we saw in the game.

Black only has a hanging pawn on a7, but it would be difficult for white to take advantage of. White has two hanging pieces; the knight on g5, and the bishop on e2, plus his a2 pawn. 2) list forcing moves (for white, since black just moved Qe5). Obviously Qxe5+, but also Ne6+ and f4. 3) after listing the candidate forcing moves, see if they leave other pieces undefended (or leave the back rank undefended, if the king has no escape!). If Qxe5, the only pieces the queen was defending was the rook on d1 (already defended by the rook on b1), the f4 pawn (already defended by white\u2019s king) and the d5 pawn (problematic) If Ne6+, no biggie, the knight was defending no pieces anyway. If f4, the g3 and e3 squares were already covered. Now we can consider the candidate moves that are left. With the exception of Qxe5, none of the other moves leave white pieces hanging (always good). Also, Qxe5 Rxe5, and Black has two attackers on the d5 pawn, and will pile on until it falls (ex: Qxe5 Rxe5, Bf3 Rd8, etc...) If f4, Black just trades queens, and then piles on until the d5 pawn hangs, so this doesn\u2019t go anywhere. So Ne6+, it is. Let\u2019s look at the lines here. 1 Ne6+ Qxe6?, 2 dxe6 fxe6 and white is better. 1 ... fxe6, 2 Qxe5 and again the black queen loses her head. 1 ... Rxe6, 2 dxe6, Qxd4, 3 Rxd4 and white is better, having gained the minor exchange of a knight for rook (roughly 2 pawns worth), and white can now double the rooks on the d-file! 1) ... Kf6, 2 Nf4 ... Again, black could trade queens, but it would leave white\u2019s rooks able to double up on the d-file, and - more important - both white\u2019s knight and bishop can now defend the d5 pawn, and black can\u2019t take the hanging knight due to the pin!

Nimzo just needs to light a fire under his queen-side pawns: b5, (knight moves), a4, (black makes a move), Ba3 (activating White's boxed-in bishop and offering to trade it for Black's monster bishop on d6). Black is still ahead -0.5 or so, which is a lot better for White than where it was after Bh5 on 8:18.\n8:24 -- Capablanca nearly kills his solid positional advantage here by playing fritter moves in the hope his opponent will fall to a trick. Black is about -2 before Qd8, but drops to -0.5 after. Why? Because it gives White a temporary breather to shore up his defenses. A nice, fat rook-lift to f6 was a better move for Black here, not Qd8. (Said exact rock lift eventually finishing the game after much other mickey-mousing around. I'd like to think that Capablanca had the closing mate-in-5 lined up in his head all the way back here, and played diversionary moves until Nimzowitsch's defenses were distracted and scattered away on other tasks.)\n10:19 -- c4 was completely unnecessary to Nimzor's plan; he should have just played Bf3 right away, or slightly better yet, Rc1 or the mentioned d5. But he didn't, and the result is that Capablanca gets his mojo back that he lost by playing Qd8 previously (see above), and the drawish position (0.00 if d5) now leans solidly for Black again.\n10:48 -- Retreating the rook to the c2 light square is a poorer choice than to the d2 or e3 dark squares; I suspect that Nimzowitsch knew this, but was hoping to hoodwink Capablanca into chasing it with Bd3, which is blunder replied with Rc3 (and now it is Black being harassed and retreating while White develops pieces for free). But Capablanca played the top-pick move of Nf6, and is once again bringing his piece majority to bear now that his own back-rank troubles have evaporated.\n11:11 -- While Bd3 was a blunder in the line explored above (in which a greedy but inattentive child might have watched Rc2, Bd3, Rc4, Be4, Bxe4, fxe4, Rxg3 lose him a piece), here it's a great move, because the knight is now already on f6, where it guards e4 (and if landing there, g3).",

Well Qf1 loses because you're not defending the e3 square enough - so you get Qf1 Rxe3, Bxe3 Qxe3+, and black's won the bishop. Qf3 is a longer line but still ultimately loses the bishop - after Qf3, black plays Rae8 to pile up on the e3 square. If white ignores this, black has too many attackers on the e3 square and after a bunch of trades black's won the bishop and gotten their piece back. To not ignore this, white has to play Rae1 to defend the e3 square.
