## Inspiration
In 2020, a popular YouTube channel was blocked for hate speech. Although terms like “black”, “white”, “attack”, “capture” were used, it was still mistakenly flagged by AI due to not understanding the context — chess. Inspired by the paper “Are Chess Discussions Racist? An Adversarial Hate Speech Data Set” (Sarker & Khudabukhsh), we improved upon an existing hate speech detection model utilizing BERT to improve its accuracy in regards to chess comments.
